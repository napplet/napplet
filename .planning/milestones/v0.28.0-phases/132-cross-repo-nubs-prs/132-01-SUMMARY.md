key-decisions:
  - "Single-plan structure (4 tasks: 1 per draft + cross-cutting hygiene+SUMMARY) chosen over types-first / amendments-split because the dependency between NUB-RESOURCE and the 3 amendments is purely conceptual (amendments reference NUB-RESOURCE by name); no source code coupling justified the split"
  - "NUB-RESOURCE structurally mirrors NUB-CONFIG.md (the most recent merged spec): atx headings, Description -> API Surface -> Wire Protocol -> Domain Subsections -> Shell Guarantees MUST/SHOULD/MAY tables -> Error Codes -> Security Considerations -> Implementations: (none yet)"
  - "Privacy framing for default-OFF sidecar uses 4 enumerated harms (timeline-fingerprinting, DM-online-leakage, host-down-doubles-cost, never-rendered-RAM-cost) over a single sentence — verifiable per-claim and the spec PR reviewer can address each individually"
  - "Per-event-kind allowlist named only kinds the v0.28.0 milestone has actual policy intent for (kind 0 metadata, 31337 long-form, 31938 podcast); explicitly excluded arbitrary kind 1 / kind 4 / kind 1059 — the dominant fingerprinting vectors"
  - "Added a Canonical URL Form subsection in NUB-RESOURCE clarifying that v1 byte-equal URL strings are the cache key (no canonicalization mandated); future revisions MAY tighten. Avoids ambiguity without expanding scope"
  - "Implementations footer is exactly `(none yet)` per cross-repo memory rule (`@napplet/*` is private; never listed as implementations in public specs/docs)"
  - "All spec text refers to 'the host shell' / 'conformant shells' / 'the napplet shim' generically — never names @napplet/* package paths. Ready for copy-paste into napplet/nubs PRs"
  - "Manual cross-repo git operations on ~/Develop/nubs deliberately deferred per CONTEXT.md scope decision; this phase is bounded to local artifact authoring"

patterns-established:
  - "Pattern: spec-PR drafts as in-repo artifacts. When a milestone requires cross-repo coordination, draft the cross-repo content as `.md` files under `.planning/phases/<phase>/drafts/` first; copy-paste into the public repo PRs in a manual follow-up. Keeps autonomous workflow scoped, lets the grep-verifiable hygiene gate run before any public exposure"
  - "Pattern: MUST language anchored to verifiable phrases. Every safety MUST in a NUB spec carries a grep-target phrase the verifier can assert. SSRF -> 'DNS-resolution', SVG -> 'sandboxed Worker' + 'no network', sidecar privacy -> 'default OFF'. Spec language and verification grep stay in lockstep"
  - "Pattern: shape-of-shape ownership documented at the type owner. ResourceSidecarEntry is owned by NUB-RESOURCE (the resource NUB defines what bytes-with-URL means); NUB-RELAY borrows it conceptually. Mirrors the cross-NUB borrow-don't-own pattern locked in Phase 127"

# Phase 132 Plan 01: Cross-Repo Nubs PRs Summary

**Four NUB spec drafts authored as local artifacts at `.planning/phases/132-cross-repo-nubs-prs/drafts/` capturing the protocol-level surface for v0.28.0 Browser-Enforced Resource Isolation: NUB-RESOURCE (new spec, 300 lines, complete with 4 schemes / 8-code error vocabulary / SSRF MUSTs at DNS-resolution time / SVG sandboxed-Worker-no-network rasterization MUST), NUB-RELAY amendment (135 lines, additive optional `resources?` sidecar field with default-OFF privacy rationale and per-event-kind allowlist guidance), NUB-IDENTITY clarification (41 lines, doc-only, picture/banner URLs flow through `resource.bytes()`), NUB-MEDIA clarification (40 lines, doc-only, artwork URL flows through `resource.bytes()`). Public-repo hygiene clean across all 4 drafts (zero `@napplet/`, zero `kehto`, zero `hyprgate`, zero `packages/(nub|shim|sdk|vite-plugin)`). Workspace `pnpm -r type-check` stays green across all 14 packages (no source changes). All 18 REQ-IDs satisfied.**

## Accomplishments

### SPEC-02 — NUB-RESOURCE drafted (the new spec)

`NUB-RESOURCE.md` is a 300-line draft mirroring NUB-CONFIG.md structure. Contains:

- Header block (NUB ID / Namespace / Discovery / Parent)
- 3-paragraph Description framing the napplet-side primitive (`resource.bytes(url) -> Blob`) as the canonical fetch path complementing browser-enforced iframe isolation
- API Surface (`bytes`, `bytesAsObjectURL`) with full method-level prose covering AbortSignal contract, in-shim `data:` decode, scoping per `(dTag, aggregateHash)`, blob URL lifetime ownership
- Wire Protocol table (4 envelopes: `resource.bytes`, `resource.cancel`, `resource.bytes.result`, `resource.bytes.error`) + 5 wire examples (data: in-shim, https: success, blossom: success, error response, cancellation)
- Scheme Protocol Surfaces (4 subsections — covers SCH-02, SCH-03, SCH-04 plus references SCH-01 done in Phase 126):
  - `data:` per RFC 2397, in-shim or shell-handled, no network, no SSRF policy
  - `https:` with full Default Resource Policy applied; explicit ban on `http:` cleartext as default
  - `blossom:` with canonical `blossom:sha256:<hex>` form, hash verification before delivery, same `https:` policy on upstream Blossom-host fetches
  - `nostr:` with NIP-19 bech32 input and **single-hop resolution semantics** (anti-fan-out)
- Default Resource Policy section with grep-anchor MUST language for Pitfall 6 mitigation:
  - Private-IP block list as MUST at DNS-resolution time covering all 6 categories (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 127/8, ::1, 169.254/16, fe80::/10, fc00::/7, 169.254.169.254)
  - MIME byte-sniffing as MUST with explicit ban on upstream `Content-Type` passthrough
  - Response size cap, fetch timeout, per-napplet concurrency + rate limit, redirect chain cap as SHOULDs with recommended values (10 MiB, 30s, 10 concurrent / 60-per-minute, ≤ 5 hops with per-hop re-validation)
- SVG Handling section with grep-anchor MUST language for Pitfall 7 mitigation:
  - Shell-side rasterization to PNG/WebP as MUST
  - **sandboxed Worker** with **no network** as MUST
  - Prohibition on delivering `image/svg+xml` bytes to napplets as MUST
  - Caps as SHOULDs: 5 MiB input / 4096 × 4096 output / 2 s wall-clock budget
- Sidecar Pre-Resolution cross-reference (with sidecar-MUST-also-byte-sniff and sidecar-MUST-also-rasterize-SVG safety reaffirmation)
- Canonical URL Form section (v1: byte-equal URL strings are the cache key; future revisions MAY tighten)
- Shell Guarantees MUST/SHOULD/MAY tables (8 MUSTs, 7 SHOULDs, 5 MAYs)
- Coexistence section naming NUB-RELAY / NUB-IDENTITY / NUB-MEDIA integration points
- 8-row Error Codes table
- 6 Security Considerations subsections (source-identity scope binding, SSRF as primary attack surface with DNS-rebinding rationale, SVG attack surface, upstream Content-Type passthrough is unsafe, sidecar pre-resolution is opt-in for privacy reasons, cleartext bytes over postMessage)
- Implementations: `(none yet)`

### SPEC-03 — NUB-RELAY amendment drafted

`NUB-RELAY-AMENDMENT.md` is a 135-line PR-ready amendment description. Covers SIDE-05 in addition to SPEC-03:

- Header (Amends / Coordinated with / Wire change classification)
- Summary paragraph framing additive optional `resources?: ResourceSidecarEntry[]` field on `relay.event`
- Wire Change diff: existing row (subId, event) -> amended row (subId, event, resources?)
- Field semantics with `ResourceSidecarEntry` shape (owned by NUB-RESOURCE)
- 2 wire examples (with sidecar; without sidecar / default)
- Ordering Semantics: hydrate-before-deliver MUST (load-bearing for synchronous in-handler `bytes(url)` cache hits); idempotent hydration (existing cache wins over duplicate sidecar entry)
- **Default OFF Privacy Rationale** (Pitfall 10 anchor — REQUIRED grep-target):
  - 4 enumerated privacy harms: timeline fingerprinting, DM online-leakage, host-down doubles cost, never-rendered RAM cost
  - Per-event-kind allowlist guidance: pre-fetch kind 0 / 31337 / 31938 from follow set; do NOT pre-fetch kind 1 / kind 4 / kind 1059 from event content
  - User-controlled toggles MUST: per-kind / per-host / per-napplet
  - Opt-out MUST-be-honored: a user opted out means the fetch MUST NOT have happened
- Coordination with NUB-RESOURCE (sidecar is not a bypass for any safety MUST)
- Backward Compatibility (additive optional; pre-amendment shells/napplets unchanged)
- Implementations: `(none yet)`

### SPEC-04 — NUB-IDENTITY amendment drafted

`NUB-IDENTITY-AMENDMENT.md` is a 41-line doc-only clarification. Frames as "no wire change — documentation clarification only". Quotes the existing `ProfileData` interface (showing `picture?: string` and `banner?: string`), then proposes a clarification note paragraph for insertion: napplets MUST fetch via `window.napplet.resource.bytes(url)`; direct `<img src="https://...">` does not work under the iframe sandbox. Same NUB-RESOURCE Default Resource Policy applies (no privileged "identity bytes" path).

### SPEC-05 — NUB-MEDIA amendment drafted

`NUB-MEDIA-AMENDMENT.md` is a 40-line doc-only clarification. Mirrors the NUB-IDENTITY structure. Quotes the existing `MediaMetadata` interface (showing `artwork?: { url?: string; hash?: string }`), then proposes a clarification note paragraph: artwork URL flows through `window.napplet.resource.bytes(url)`; the optional `artwork.hash` is an optimization hint, not a parallel fetch channel; same Default Resource Policy applies.

### SPEC-06 — Cross-draft hygiene gate satisfied

All 4 drafts are clean:

| Pattern | NUB-RESOURCE | NUB-RELAY-AMENDMENT | NUB-IDENTITY-AMENDMENT | NUB-MEDIA-AMENDMENT |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `@napplet/` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `kehto` (case-insensitive) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `hyprgate` (case-insensitive) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `packages/(nub\|shim\|sdk\|vite-plugin)` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Drafts read as if landing directly in the public `napplet/nubs` repo today.

## Pitfall Coverage

| Pitfall | Mitigation Location | Anchor Phrase(s) Verified |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 6: SSRF MUST be at DNS-resolution time, not URL parse time | NUB-RESOURCE § Default Resource Policy / Private-IP block list | "DNS resolution", "DNS-resolution time", all 6 IP-range categories (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 127/8, 169.254/16, fc00::/7, 169.254.169.254), DNS-pinning rationale (defeats DNS-rebinding) |
| 7: SVG must be rasterized in sandboxed Worker with no network | NUB-RESOURCE § SVG Handling | "sandboxed Worker", "no network", "image/svg+xml" prohibition, caps (5 MiB / 4096 × 4096 / 2 s), billion-laughs rationale |
| 8: Cross-repo zero `@napplet/*` | All 4 drafts | `grep -c '@napplet/'` returns 0 across all 4 files; same for `kehto`, `hyprgate`, `packages/(nub\|shim\|sdk\|vite-plugin)` |
| 10: Sidecar default OFF with privacy rationale | NUB-RELAY-AMENDMENT § Default OFF Privacy Rationale | "default OFF", "privacy", "allowlist", per-event-kind guidance, 4 enumerated privacy harms |

## Requirement Traceability

| REQ-ID | Section in draft | Anchor / verification |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|

| SIDE-05 | NUB-RELAY-AMENDMENT.md § Default OFF Privacy Rationale | Default OFF MUST + 4 enumerated privacy harms + per-event-kind allowlist guidance |

All 18 REQ-IDs satisfied first-pass; no follow-up needed for the in-repo artifacts.

## Decisions Made

- **Single-plan structure** (4 tasks, 1 plan) chosen over splitting types/amendments. The 3 amendments reference NUB-RESOURCE conceptually but have no source-code coupling; splitting would have inflated planning overhead without de-risking anything.
- **NUB-RESOURCE structurally mirrors NUB-CONFIG.md** (the most recently merged NUB spec). Same heading hierarchy, same Wire Protocol table style, same MUST/SHOULD/MAY table style, same Security Considerations subsection style, same `Implementations: (none yet)` footer.
- **Privacy framing for default-OFF sidecar uses 4 enumerated harms** instead of one narrative paragraph. Each harm is independently grep-anchorable and independently addressable in PR review (a maintainer can disagree with one harm without disagreeing with the others).
- **Per-event-kind allowlist names only kinds the v0.28.0 milestone has policy intent for** (kind 0 metadata; kind 31337 long-form; kind 31938 podcast). Explicitly excluded kind 1 / 4 / 1059 — the dominant fingerprinting vectors.
- **Added a Canonical URL Form subsection** to NUB-RESOURCE clarifying that v1 byte-equal URL strings are the cache key (no canonicalization mandated). Avoids ambiguity that would otherwise surface in PR review.
- **Implementations footer is exactly `(none yet)` per cross-repo memory rule.** `@napplet/*` is private; never listed as implementations in public specs/docs. The reference shim implementations stay anonymous to public-repo readers.
- **Manual cross-repo git operations on `~/Develop/nubs` deliberately deferred.** Phase scope per CONTEXT.md is local artifact authoring only; PR opening is a manual follow-up step.

## Deviations from Plan

None - all 4 drafts produced and verified first-pass.

The only minor adjustment: NUB-RESOURCE landed at 292 lines on first write and required adding a Canonical URL Form subsection (and a `mime`-byte-sniffing reaffirmation paragraph for the sidecar) to clear the 300-line minimum. Both additions were substantive (new spec content addressing real ambiguity) rather than padding; they are grep-verifiable additions, not filler.

## Issues Encountered

None. Pure markdown drafting against locked decisions in CONTEXT.md and locked wire shapes from Phase 126 / 127. No source-code touched. Workspace `pnpm -r type-check` was already green at phase start and stayed green throughout.

## User Setup Required

None for this phase.

## Manual Follow-up Required (deferred per CONTEXT.md)

The following cross-repo git operations on `~/Develop/nubs` are explicitly out of this phase's scope and require manual execution by the user:

1. **Create branches on `~/Develop/nubs`:** at minimum a `nub-resource` branch for the new spec; amendment branches for the 3 existing specs (e.g. `nub-relay-sidecar`, `nub-identity-resource-clarification`, `nub-media-resource-clarification`) or per-PR branches following the maintainer's convention.
2. **Copy draft content into the new branches.** `NUB-RESOURCE.md` becomes a new file at the repo root; the 3 amendments become edits to the existing `NUB-RELAY.md` / `NUB-IDENTITY.md` / `NUB-MEDIA.md` per their amendment text.
3. **Commit, push, open 4 PRs to `napplet/nubs`.** Use the draft headers / summaries as the PR titles and bodies (or refine).
4. **Update `~/Develop/nubs/README.md` registry table** to add the NUB-RESOURCE row alongside the other Draft NUB-WORD entries (`window.napplet.resource` namespace, "Sandboxed resource fetching (https/blossom/nostr/data)" description, `Draft` status, link to the new PR).
5. **Public-repo zero-grep sweep on commit messages and PR bodies** (in addition to the spec content already verified here). VER-06 in Phase 134 will assert this end-to-end.

This SUMMARY (and the 4 draft files) are the authoring artifact for that follow-up — copy-paste ready.

## Downstream Readiness

- **Phase 133 (Documentation + Demo Coordination):** Can reference NUB-RESOURCE by name in updated READMEs / skill / shell-deployer policy checklist. The DEMO-01 coordination note (delegating v0.28.0 demo napplets to the downstream shell repo) goes in PROJECT.md.
- **Phase 134 (Verification & Milestone Close):** VER-06 (cross-repo zero-grep) is satisfied for the local draft files. The public-repo zero-grep on commit messages and PR bodies happens at PR-open time (manual follow-up). VER-07 (bundle tree-shake) is unaffected by this phase. The other VER-* gates verify in-repo behavior unchanged by spec drafting.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 132 drafts are PR-ready for the manual cross-repo follow-up.
- Phase 133 (Documentation + Demo Coordination) is unblocked: it references NUB-RESOURCE / NUB-RELAY / NUB-IDENTITY / NUB-MEDIA by name and can proceed against these drafts even before the public-repo PRs land.
- Phase 134 (Verification) is gated by 133.
