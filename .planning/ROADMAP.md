### v0.11.0 Clean up Side Panel (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make the side panel contextual and better organized -- constants filter to the selected node, Kinds get their own tab, and editable values are separated from read-only constants.

- [x] **Phase 54: Data Layer** - Add role annotations and query methods to ConstantDef for downstream filtering (completed 2026-04-04)
- [x] **Phase 55: Tab Reorganization** - Split Kinds into a read-only tab, constrain Constants to editable values, and fix tab persistence (completed 2026-04-04)
- [x] **Phase 56: Contextual Filtering** - Filter constants by selected node role with show-all fallback and toggle (completed 2026-04-04)

## Phase Details

### Phase 54: Data Layer
**Goal**: The constants data model knows which topology roles each constant is relevant to and can be queried by role, editability, and category
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v0.11.0)
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every ConstantDef entry has a relevantRoles field (empty array means global/always-show)
  2. Calling getEditableDefs() returns only editable constants (expected: 17 items)
  3. Calling getReadOnlyDefs() returns only read-only constants (expected: 10 items, including 9 kinds)
  4. Calling getByRole('runtime') returns only constants annotated as relevant to the runtime role
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 54-01-PLAN.md -- Add relevantRoles field and query methods to ConstantDef and DemoConfig

### Phase 55: Tab Reorganization
**Goal**: Users see three distinct inspector tabs -- Node, Constants (editable only), and Kinds (read-only protocol references) -- and their active tab stays selected when clicking different nodes
**Depends on**: Phase 54
**Requirements**: TAB-01, TAB-02, TAB-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A "Kinds" tab exists in the inspector showing all 9 protocol kind numbers as read-only reference cards (no sliders or edit controls)
  2. The "Constants" tab shows only editable behavioral values with live-edit controls (sliders, inputs, reset buttons)
  3. Selecting a different topology node does not reset the active tab back to "Node" -- the user's tab choice persists across node selections
  4. The 1500ms polling timer only re-renders when the Node tab is active (does not destroy slider/input focus on Constants or Kinds tabs)
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 55-01-PLAN.md -- Create kinds-panel.ts and constrain constants-panel.ts to editable-only
- [x] 55-02-PLAN.md -- Wire 3-tab system, fix tab persistence, guard polling timer
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 56: Contextual Filtering
**Goal**: Users see only the constants relevant to the node they have selected, with clear fallback and escape-hatch behaviors
**Depends on**: Phase 55
**Requirements**: FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Selecting a topology node (e.g., "runtime") filters the Constants tab to show only constants with that role in their relevantRoles (plus globals)
  2. When no node is selected, the Constants tab shows all editable constants (no empty or broken state)
  3. A visible "show all" toggle lets the user bypass contextual filtering and see all constants regardless of the selected node
  4. When the contextual filter produces zero results for a role, a meaningful empty-state message is shown with a link/button to show all
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 56-01-PLAN.md -- Add role-based contextual filtering with toggle and empty state to Constants tab
**UI hint**: yes
