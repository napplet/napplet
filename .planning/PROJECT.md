# Napplet Protocol SDK

## What This Is

A portable SDK for the napplet protocol — sandboxed Nostr mini-apps that run in restrictive iframes and delegate functionality (signing, storage, relay access) to a host shell via NIP-01 postMessage wire format. Extracted from [hyprgate](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/hyprgate) into standalone `@napplet/*` npm packages. Includes a 66-test protocol conformance suite and an interactive Chat + Bot demo playground.

## Core Value

Prove that sandboxed Nostr apps can securely delegate to a host shell over a simple, standardized protocol — and ship the spec + SDK so others can build on it.

## Requirements

### Active
- [ ] Publish all @napplet/* packages to npm (@napplet/shim, @napplet/shell, @napplet/acl, @napplet/core, @napplet/runtime, @napplet/services, @napplet/vite-plugin)
- [ ] Napplet boilerplate / starter template (@napplet/create CLI)
- [ ] Deploy demo as production nsite (blossom + relay + NIP-5A gateway)
- [ ] Event-ID triggered aggregate hash revalidation
- [ ] Salt-based deterministic keypair derivation
- [ ] Service ACL — per-service capability strings (service:audio, service:notifications)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile native wrapper — web-first protocol, native later
- Framework-specific bindings (Svelte/React components) — SDK is framework-agnostic by design
- Multi-shell federation — single shell per page for v1
- IndexedDB storage backend — localStorage sufficient for v1
- Key rotation for ephemeral keypairs — complexity not justified yet
- Rate limiting on signer requests — document expected behavior, don't enforce yet
- Restrictive ACL default mode — permissive default for developer adoption (v0.2.0 adds proper enforcement, restrictive mode later)
- Manifest signature verification in shell — deferred to post-v1 security hardening
- NIP PR submission — spec needs iterations before community submission

## Context

- **Current state**: v0.5.0 shipped (2026-04-01). All 7 packages documented with READMEs. SPEC.md fully updated for v0.4.0 protocol. 3 agentskills.io skill files enable agents/developers to build with napplet. 44 files changed, 6,819 lines added across v0.5.0.
- **Package architecture**: core(0 deps) → acl(0 deps) → runtime(core+acl) → shell(core+runtime) | shim(core) | services(runtime). Runtime is browser-agnostic via RuntimeHooks DI. 7 packages total.
- **Tech stack**: TypeScript 5.9, Vite 6.3, tsup 8.5, turborepo 2.5, pnpm 10.8, Vitest 4 + Playwright for testing, UnoCSS for demo styling.
- **Test coverage**: 122 Playwright e2e tests + 71 vitest unit/integration tests (~193 total, plus ~29 service/discovery tests added in v0.4.0). Coverage spans AUTH, routing, replay, lifecycle, ACL enforcement, storage, signer, inter-pane, core imports, runtime dispatch, service dispatch, service discovery, and compatibility.
- **Documentation**: All 7 packages have README.md. SPEC.md (41KB+) covers full protocol including Section 11 service discovery. 3 portable skill files in skills/ directory.
- **Known remaining issues**: Permissive ACL default. postMessage origin '*' trust boundary. Fake event IDs on shell-injected events. npm publish blocked on human auth. nappState/nappStorage alias undocumented.
- **NIP-5A spec**: Refined SPEC.md at repo root (41KB+). References NIP-5A and nostr-protocol/nips#2287 for aggregate hash. Section 11 defines Service Discovery protocol (kind 29010).

## Constraints

- **ESM-only**: No CJS output — all packages are ESM
- **Zero framework deps**: No Svelte, React, Vue — framework-agnostic SDK
- **nostr-tools peer dep**: shim and shell depend on nostr-tools >=2.23.3 <3.0.0
- **iframe sandbox**: No allow-same-origin — everything proxied via postMessage
- **Monorepo tooling**: pnpm workspaces + turborepo + tsup + changesets

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Extract from hyprgate rather than rewrite | Proven protocol implementation, minimize risk | ✓ Good — packages working with targeted fixes |
| Behavioral tests over unit tests first | Visually confirm protocol works end-to-end before testing internals | ✓ Good — 66 Playwright tests prove the protocol |
| Refine existing NIP-5A spec, not write new | Spec already captures protocol; implementation surfaced 11 needed changes | ✓ Good — SPEC.md refined with all implementation learnings |
| Permissive ACL default kept for v0.1 | Ease of development; document risk, add restrictive mode later | ✓ Good — tests verify permissive behavior, restrictive mode deferred |
| Relay URI `shell://` | Clear direction signal (napplet → shell) | ✓ Good |
| Storage keys() uses repeated NIP tags | Follows Nostr convention, eliminates comma-join delimiter bug | ✓ Good |
| Missing AUTH tags fail (strict) | Napplets must build correctly; prevents misconfigured apps | ✓ Good — AUTH-08/09 tests verify |
| Pre-AUTH queue capped at 50 | Prevents memory abuse, configurable globally and per-napp | ✓ Good |
| Vite plugin is dev-only | Community deploy tools handle production manifests | ✓ Good — clear separation of concerns |
| Chat + Bot demo napplets | Interactive, demonstrates all capabilities, teachable bot | ✓ Good |
| UnoCSS for demo styling | Tailwind-compatible, Vite ecosystem, easy to modify | ✓ Good |
| UTF-8 byte count for storage quota | Consistent cross-platform, replaces inconsistent Blob approach | ✓ Good |
| @napplet/acl as separate package | Package boundary enforces zero deps, WASM-ready | ✓ Good — Phase 8 delivered zero-dep pure module |
| Target architecture: acl → core → runtime → shell | Multi-shell support. Third-party shells depend on @napplet/runtime, not @napplet/shell. Runtime extraction when second shell exists. | ✓ Good — Phase 13 delivered browser-agnostic runtime with RuntimeHooks interface |
| ServiceDescriptor in @napplet/core, ServiceHandler/Registry in @napplet/runtime | Shared types need no dependency on runtime; handler interface lives where it's consumed | ✓ Good — clean layering across all 7 packages |
| handleMessage(windowId, message, send) interface for ServiceHandler | Services receive raw NIP-01 arrays + send callback; decoupled from runtime internals | ✓ Good — consistent across all concrete services |
| Dual-path dispatch for core infra (service → hook fallback) | Backwards-compatible migration; shell hosts using RuntimeHooks directly still work | ✓ Good — zero breaking changes, SVC-04 satisfied |
| audio:* topic prefix only (shell:audio-* dropped) | Alpha — no external consumers; clean break prevents legacy accumulation | ✓ Good — no compatibility burden |
| Undeclared service consent reuses ConsentRequest pattern | Same hook, same UX flow as destructive signing kinds — shell hosts get one integration point | ✓ Good — minimal API surface growth |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? -> Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? -> Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check -- still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope -- reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state

## Next Milestone Goals

Next milestone candidates (run `/gsd:new-milestone` to define):
- Publish all @napplet/* packages to npm (blocked on human npm auth)
- @napplet/create CLI / starter template
- Deploy demo as production nsite
- Protocol hardening (aggregate hash revalidation, keypair derivation)
- Service ACL (per-service capability strings)
