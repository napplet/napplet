# Napplet Protocol SDK

## Current Milestone: v0.27.0 IFC Terminology Lock-In

**Goal:** Finish the IPC→IFC rename across first-party source, published READMEs, specs, and skills — zero `ipc`/`IPC`/`IPC_PEER`/`IPC-PEER`/"inter-pane" remaining outside historical archives.

**Target features:**
- Rename `window.napplet.ipc` namespace → `window.napplet.ifc` (breaking API change, no backward-compat alias)
- Rename `@napplet/sdk` `ipc` named export → `ifc`
- Rename `IPC_PEER` constant (and any `ipc:*` topic constants) → IFC equivalents
- Rewrite "IPC-PEER" / "inter-pane" / "inter-napplet" phrasing across root README, four package READMEs, core types/topics/envelope JSDoc, and `skills/build-napplet/SKILL.md`
- Sweep active planning docs (PROJECT.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, codebase/) so forward-looking context matches the code; leave archived milestone artifacts as history
- Verify no stale IPC references leak into public specs or first-party source

## Shipped: v0.26.0 Better Packages

Consolidated the 9 separate `@napplet/nub-<domain>` packages into a single tree-shakable `@napplet/nub` with 34 subpath entry points (9 barrel + 9 types + 8 shim + 8 sdk — theme is types-only). The 9 old packages became 1-line `export * from '@napplet/nub/<domain>'` re-export shims with `[DEPRECATED]` metadata + README banners (one-release deprecation cycle; removal deferred to a future milestone via `REMOVE-01..03`). `@napplet/shim` migrated to `/shim` granular subpaths; `@napplet/sdk` migrated to `/<domain>` barrels; 0 `@napplet/nub-` specifiers remain in first-party source. Root + 4 package READMEs rewritten; defunct `@napplet/nub-signer` references purged. Tree-shaking contract proven (39-byte bundle for types-only consumer, 0 `registerNub`, 0 cross-domain leakage). 5 phases, 12 plans shipped 2026-04-19. See [archive](milestones/v0.26.0-ROADMAP.md).

## What This Is

A portable SDK for the napplet protocol — sandboxed Nostr mini-apps that run in restrictive iframes and delegate functionality (signing, storage, relay access) to a host shell via JSON envelope postMessage wire format defined by NIP-5D.

## Core Value

Prove that sandboxed Nostr apps can securely delegate to a host shell over a simple, standardized protocol — and ship the spec + SDK so others can build on it.

## Shipped: v0.25.0 Config NUB

NUB-CONFIG spec (napplet/nubs#13) for per-napplet declarative configuration. `@napplet/nub-config` (9th NUB, 13th package) with 8 wire message types (registerSchema, get, subscribe, unsubscribe, openSettings, values, registerSchema.result, schemaError). JSON Schema draft-07 Core Subset (`pattern` excluded per CVE-2025-69873). Shell is sole writer; subscribe-live value delivery with ref-counted subscribers. Vite-plugin extension: `configSchema` option with 3-path discovery (inline / config.schema.json / napplet.config.ts), `['config', ...]` manifest tag, `config:schema` synthetic aggregateHash prefix, `<meta name="napplet-config-schema">` injection, build-time structural guards. `x-napplet-secret`/`-section`/`-order` + `deprecationMessage` + `markdownDescription` as potentialities. FromSchema type inference via json-schema-to-ts optional peer. All docs updated. 6 phases shipped 2026-04-17. See [archive](milestones/v0.25.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.24.0 Identity NUB + Kill NIP-07

Removed `window.nostr` (NIP-07) from napplets — napplets can no longer sign or encrypt. Deleted `@napplet/nub-signer` entirely. Created `@napplet/nub-identity` (read-only user queries: getPublicKey, getRelays, getProfile, getFollows, getList, getZaps, getMutes, getBlocked, getBadges). Added `relay.publishEncrypted` for shell-mediated crypto (NIP-44 default). Shell auto-decrypts incoming encrypted events. NIP-5D updated with security rationale. NUB-IDENTITY spec: napplet/nubs#12. 6 phases shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.24.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.23.0 Notify NUB

NUB-NOTIFY spec (napplet/nubs#11) for shell-rendered notifications. `@napplet/nub-notify` (8th NUB, 12th package) with 11 message types covering send/dismiss, permissions, actions, channels, badges, priority levels, and shell capability detection. Types + shim + SDK per modular pattern. Core/shim/SDK integrated. All docs updated. 4 phases shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.23.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.22.0 Media NUB + Kill Services

Killed the `svc:` capability namespace — everything is a NUB. Dropped 4 deferred AUDIO_* TOPICS. Drafted NUB-MEDIA spec (napplet/nubs#10) for media session delegation: explicit sessions, multiple per napplet, dynamic capabilities, dual volume, shell control list, full metadata with blossom hash artwork. Created `@napplet/nub-media` (7th NUB, 11th package) with types + shim + SDK per modular pattern. Core/shim/SDK integrated. All docs updated. 5 phases shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.22.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.21.0 NUB Modularization

Moved ALL domain-specific logic from `@napplet/shim` and `@napplet/sdk` into the 5 NUB packages. Each NUB now exports `shim.ts` (installer + message handlers) and `sdk.ts` (convenience wrappers) alongside its type definitions. Shim went from 19KB to 5.75KB — now a thin host that imports NUB installers. Old domain files (`relay-shim.ts`, `state-shim.ts`, `keys-shim.ts`) deleted. DX unchanged: `import '@napplet/shim'` installs all NUBs; named exports allow cherry-picking. 3 phases shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.21.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.20.0 Keys NUB

New `@napplet/nub-keys` package (6th NUB, 10th package) implementing the NUB-KEYS spec (napplet/nubs#9). Bidirectional keyboard protocol: napplet registers named actions, shell binds keys and pushes binding updates, shim suppresses bound keys locally and triggers actions with zero latency. Replaced one-way `keyboard-shim.ts` with full `keys-shim.ts` smart forwarding. SDK convenience wrappers. All READMEs and NIP-5D updated. 5 phases, 2 plans shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.20.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.19.0 Spec Gap Drops

Executed all 7 "drop" verdicts from the v0.18.0 spec conformance audit. Deleted `Capability` type, `ALL_CAPABILITIES`, 13 TOPICS entries (superseded/config/relay), `SHELL_BRIDGE_URI`, `REPLAY_WINDOW_SECONDS`, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and `constants.ts` entirely. `@napplet/core` now exports only spec-backed artifacts. 1 phase, 1 plan shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.19.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.18.0 Spec Conformance Audit

Audited entire codebase against NIP-5D and NUB specs. Removed dead code (handshake types, unused functions, dead re-exports). Created exhaustive spec gap inventory (SPEC-GAPS.md) documenting every unspecced artifact. Fixed stale documentation across 5 files. Captured drop/defer/amend decisions for all gaps: 7 items to drop in v0.19.0, 5 deferred, 1 for spec amendment (keyboard forwarding). Corrected inventory: IFC channels and nostrdb are spec-backed via draft NUB PRs. 4 phases, 4 plans shipped 2026-04-09. See [archive](milestones/v0.18.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.17.0 Capability Cleanup

All READMEs updated. 3 phases, 3 plans shipped 2026-04-08. See [archive](milestones/v0.17.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.16.0 Wire Format & NUB Architecture

Replaced NIP-01 array wire format with generic JSON envelope `{ type: "domain.action", ...payload }`. NIP-5D v4 is now transport+identity+manifest+NUB-negotiation only — zero protocol messages. 4 NUB packages (@napplet/nub-relay, nub-signer, nub-storage, nub-ifc) with 52 typed message definitions. Core dispatch infrastructure with registerNub/dispatch. Shim fully migrated to JSON envelope. SDK re-exports 62 NUB types. Protocol version 4.0.0. 6 phases, 10 plans shipped 2026-04-07. See [archive](milestones/v0.16.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.15.0 Protocol Simplification

Removed cryptographic identity from the napplet wire protocol. Napplets now send plain unsigned NIP-01 messages; shell identifies senders via unforgeable MessageEvent.source at iframe creation. AUTH handshake (REGISTER/IDENTITY/AUTH) eliminated. @napplet/shim dropped nostr-tools dependency. Protocol version bumped to 3.0.0. NIP-5D and all READMEs updated. 4 phases, 4 plans shipped 2026-04-07. See [archive](milestones/v0.15.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.14.0 Repo Cleanup & Audit

Dead code, stale docs, and leftover artifacts from v0.13.0 extraction cleaned up. 2 phases, 3 plans shipped 2026-04-06. See [archive](milestones/v0.14.0-ROADMAP.md).

See [archive](milestones/v0.12.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.11.0 Clean up Side Panel

Inspector side panel reorganized into 3 tabs (Node/Constants/Kinds) with contextual filtering. Data layer extended with role annotations and query methods. Constants tab shows only editable values filtered by selected topology node. Kinds tab shows read-only protocol references. Tab persistence across node selection. Show-all toggle escape hatch. 3 phases, 4 plans shipped 2026-04-05. See [archive](milestones/v0.11.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.10.0 Demo Consistency and Usability Pass

## Shipped: v0.8.0 Shim/SDK Split

`@napplet/shim` is now a pure side-effect window installer (zero named exports). `window.napplet` is fully namespaced (`relay`, `ipc`, `services`, `storage`). New `@napplet/sdk` package provides typed named exports for bundler consumers. All deprecated v0.7.0 symbols removed. 4 phases, 10 plans shipped 2026-04-02. See [archive](milestones/v0.8.0-ROADMAP.md).

## Shipped: v0.6.0 Demo Upgrade

### Active

- [ ] **API-01**: `window.napplet.ipc` renamed to `window.napplet.ifc` across shim, core types, and every first-party caller — no backward-compat alias
- [ ] **API-02**: `@napplet/sdk` exports `ifc` (not `ipc`) as the named namespace export
- [ ] **CONST-01**: Every IPC-branded symbol in `@napplet/core` (identifiers, JSDoc, topic strings) renamed to the IFC equivalent
- [ ] **DOC-01**: Root `README.md` + `packages/{core,shim,sdk}/README.md` updated — no `ipc` / `IPC-PEER` / "inter-pane" outside historical context
- [ ] **DOC-02**: `skills/build-napplet/SKILL.md` updated — description line, inter-pane phrasing, and code samples aligned with IFC
- [ ] **DOC-03**: `packages/nub/src/ifc/sdk.ts` JSDoc references `window.napplet.ifc` (not `.ipc`)
- [ ] **PLAN-01**: Active planning docs (`PROJECT.md`, `STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/codebase/*.md`) reflect IFC terminology; archived milestone dirs intentionally left unchanged
- [ ] **VER-01**: Monorepo `pnpm -r build` + `pnpm -r type-check` green across all 14 packages with IFC-renamed surface
- [ ] **VER-02**: Repo-wide grep for `\bIPC\b` / `\bipc\b` / `IPC_PEER` / `IPC-PEER` / `inter-pane` returns zero matches outside `.planning/milestones/` and `.planning/quick/` archives

### Future Requirements (deferred from v0.26.0)

- REMOVE-01: Delete the 9 deprecated `@napplet/nub-<domain>` packages from the repo
- REMOVE-02: Remove the deprecated packages from the publish workflow and pnpm-workspace.yaml
- REMOVE-03: Remove deprecation banners / `@deprecated` metadata references

### Out of Scope

- Mobile native wrapper — web-first protocol, native later
- Framework-specific bindings (Svelte/React components) — SDK is framework-agnostic by design
- Multi-shell federation — single shell per page for v1
- IndexedDB storage backend — localStorage sufficient for v1
- Key rotation for delegated keypairs — complexity not justified yet
- Rate limiting on signer requests — document expected behavior, don't enforce yet
- Restrictive ACL default mode — permissive default for developer adoption (v0.2.0 adds proper enforcement, restrictive mode later)
- Manifest signature verification in shell — deferred to post-v1 security hardening
- Arbitrary custom napplet loading in the demo shell — defer until the built-in demo is architecture-accurate and trustworthy again
- DAW implementation or audio-specific protocols — NIP-5C only designs the channel primitive that could support it

## Context

- **Current state**: v0.26.0 shipped (Better Packages). 14 packages: 4 core SDK (core, shim, sdk, vite-plugin) + consolidated `@napplet/nub` with 34 subpath entry points + 9 deprecated `@napplet/nub-<domain>` re-export shims (slated for removal in a future milestone). 26 milestones shipped.
- **Package architecture**: @napplet: core(0 deps) | nub(core) | shim(core+nub) | sdk(core+nub) | vite-plugin. Deprecated `@napplet/nub-<domain>` (×9) re-export `@napplet/nub/<domain>` and are kept for one release cycle. Shell runtime packages in a separate repo.
- **Spec status**: NIP-5D v2 at 199 lines covers AUTH handshake, relay proxy, capability discovery, and NUB extension reference. Ready for PR submission to nostr-protocol/nips.
- **NUB specs**: 6 interface specs drafted in `specs/nubs/` (RELAY, STORAGE, SIGNER, NOSTRDB, IPC, PIPES). Governance framework defined but not formalized (NUB-01/02/03 deferred).
- **Demo architecture**: Full topology view with distinct shell, ACL, runtime, and service nodes. Inspector has 3 tabs (Node, Constants, Kinds) with contextual filtering.
- **Tech stack**: TypeScript 5.9, Vite 6.3, tsup 8.5, turborepo 2.5, pnpm 10.8, Vitest 4 + Playwright for testing, UnoCSS for demo styling.
- **Test coverage**: 122 Playwright e2e tests + 71 vitest unit/integration tests (~193 total). Coverage spans AUTH, routing, replay, lifecycle, ACL enforcement, storage, signer, inter-pane, core imports, runtime dispatch, service dispatch, service discovery, and compatibility.
- **Documentation**: All 8 packages have README.md. RUNTIME-SPEC.md (41KB+) covers full protocol. NIP-5D.md is the terse external spec. 3 portable skill files in skills/ directory.
- **Known remaining issues**: Permissive ACL default. postMessage origin '*' trust boundary. Fake event IDs on shell-injected events. npm publish blocked on human auth. NIP number conflict with Scrolls PR#2281 (RES-01). No automated e2e tests for REGISTER/IDENTITY step (covered by UAT only).

## Constraints

- **ESM-only**: No CJS output — all packages are ESM
- **Zero framework deps**: No Svelte, React, Vue — framework-agnostic SDK
- **nostr-tools peer dep**: shim and shell depend on nostr-tools >=2.23.3 <3.0.0
- **iframe sandbox**: No allow-same-origin — everything proxied via postMessage
- **Monorepo tooling**: pnpm workspaces + turborepo + tsup + changesets

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Extract from reference implementation rather than rewrite | Proven protocol implementation, minimize risk | ✓ Good — packages working with targeted fixes |
| Behavioral tests over unit tests first | Visually confirm protocol works end-to-end before testing internals | ✓ Good — 66 Playwright tests prove the protocol |
| Refine existing NIP-5A spec, not write new | Spec already captures protocol; implementation surfaced 11 needed changes | ✓ Good — SPEC.md refined with all implementation learnings |
| Permissive ACL default kept for v0.1 | Ease of development; document risk, add restrictive mode later | ✓ Good — tests verify permissive behavior, restrictive mode deferred |
| Relay URI `shell://` | Clear direction signal (napplet → shell) | ✓ Good |
| Storage keys() uses repeated NIP tags | Follows Nostr convention, eliminates comma-join delimiter bug | ✓ Good |
| Missing AUTH tags fail (strict) | Napplets must build correctly; prevents misconfigured apps | ✓ Good — AUTH-08/09 tests verify |
| Pre-AUTH queue capped at 50 | Prevents memory abuse, configurable globally and per-napp | ✓ Good |
| Vite plugin is dev-only | Community deploy tools handle production manifests | ✓ Good — clear separation of concerns |
| Chat + Bot demo napplets | Interactive, demonstrates all capabilities, teachable bot | ✓ Good |
| UnoCSS for demo styling | Tailwind-compatible, Vite ecosystem, easy to modify | ✓ Good |
| UTF-8 byte count for storage quota | Consistent cross-platform, replaces inconsistent Blob approach | ✓ Good |
| @napplet/acl as separate package | Package boundary enforces zero deps, WASM-ready | ✓ Good — Phase 8 delivered zero-dep pure module |
| Target architecture: acl → core → runtime → shell | Multi-shell support. Third-party shells depend on @napplet/runtime, not @napplet/shell. Runtime extraction when second shell exists. | ✓ Good — Phase 13 delivered browser-agnostic runtime with RuntimeHooks interface |
| ServiceDescriptor in @napplet/core, ServiceHandler/Registry in @napplet/runtime | Shared types need no dependency on runtime; handler interface lives where it's consumed | ✓ Good — clean layering across all 7 packages |
| handleMessage(windowId, message, send) interface for ServiceHandler | Services receive raw NIP-01 arrays + send callback; decoupled from runtime internals | ✓ Good — consistent across all concrete services |
| Dual-path dispatch for core infra (service → hook fallback) | Backwards-compatible migration; shell hosts using RuntimeHooks directly still work | ✓ Good — zero breaking changes, SVC-04 satisfied |
| audio:* topic prefix only (shell:audio-* dropped) | Alpha — no external consumers; clean break prevents legacy accumulation | ✓ Good — no compatibility burden |
| Undeclared service consent reuses ConsentRequest pattern | Same hook, same UX flow as destructive signing kinds — shell hosts get one integration point | ✓ Good — minimal API surface growth |
| Demo must mirror actual runtime architecture | The demo is now a teaching tool and debugger; flattening shell/ACL/runtime hides the protocol model and misleads users | Phase 27 established the audited host/debugger truth; Phase 28 will finish the topology UI |
| Custom napplet loading deferred until after demo refresh | First make the built-in demo accurate and debuggable before opening a generic test harness | Pending post-v0.6.0 review |
| HMAC-SHA256(shellSecret, dTag+aggregateHash) for key derivation | Deterministic, standard primitive, shell secret never exposed to napplet | ✓ Good — same napplet always gets same keypair |
| Hash mismatch warns but doesn't block registration | Adoption-friendly — developers aren't locked out during development | ✓ Good — onHashMismatch callback gives host apps flexibility |
| Triple-read storage migration across 3 historical formats | Zero data loss on upgrade — reads new format, then legacy with pubkey, then old napp-state: prefix | ✓ Good — backward compat with no user action |
| SEC-01 explicit BusKind allowlist (not 29000-29999 range) | Principle of least privilege — future bus kinds must opt in | ✓ Good — though SPEC.md says range (known debt) |
| SPEC.md → RUNTIME-SPEC.md with internal-reference header | Distinguishes internal reference from NIP standard; header links to NIP-5D | ✓ Good — no confusion between runtime spec and protocol NIP |
| Historical PROJECT.md SPEC.md references left as-is | These are milestone descriptions, not active cross-references | ✓ Good — avoids rewriting history |
| Remove crypto from napplet wire protocol | message.source is unforgeable; napplet can't hash itself; shell knows identity at iframe creation | ✓ Good — simpler spec, thinner shim, crypto is runtime impl detail |
| Protocol version 2.0.0 → 3.0.0 | Breaking change to handshake; downstream shell must update | ✓ Good — clean break |
| Replace NIP-01 arrays with JSON envelope | NIP-5D should describe transport, not relay semantics; simpler for NIP reviewers and shell implementors | ✓ Good — spec is 120 lines, 5-minute read |
| NUBs own protocol messages, NIP-5D is transport-only | Composable: shells implement only the NUBs they support | ✓ Good — modular spec architecture |
| Sandbox: allow-scripts only | Minimal trust; everything else is shell-granted privilege | ✓ Good — follows principle of least privilege |
| Namespaced shell.supports() with nub:/perm:/svc: prefixes | Flat NubDomain\|string caused collision risk; three namespaces with explicit prefixes; bare NUB shorthand kept for ergonomics | ✓ Good — replaced v0.16.0 flat API |
| NUB-IFC merges IPC + PIPES | dispatch (per-msg ACL) and channel (ACL at open) are modes, not separate specs | ✓ Good — one NUB, two patterns |
| Protocol version 3.0.0 → 4.0.0 | JSON envelope replaces NIP-01 arrays; breaking wire format change | ✓ Good — clean break |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? -> Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? -> Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check -- still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope -- reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state

## Future Milestone Candidates
