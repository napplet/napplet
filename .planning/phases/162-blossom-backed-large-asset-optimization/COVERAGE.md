# Phase 162 Coverage Contract

**Status:** Planning input
**Protocol posture:** This is a non-normative implementation coverage index. The living sources linked below remain authoritative; this file does not define a NIP, NAP, BUD, manifest field, message, or conformance requirement.

## Requirement and Probe Status

- ROADMAP assigns no phase requirement IDs (`Requirements: TBD`), so plan frontmatter uses `requirements: []` and does not invent IDs.
- The spec-less fallback probe was visibly skipped because there are no requirement IDs to probe. No probe-derived predicates were generated.
- Plan must-haves instead lift the complete CONTEXT decisions, canonical prohibitions, validation rows, and user acceptance evidence below.

## Decision Ledger

The source CONTEXT has no numbered decision labels, so this phase-local ledger assigns planning-only trace IDs without changing the decisions or creating protocol identifiers.

| ID | Locked decision | Planned coverage |
|----|-----------------|------------------|
| D-01 | Measure the would-be `/index.html`; activate only when bytes are greater than exactly `2 * 1024 * 1024`. | 162-01, 162-06, 162-07 |
| D-02 | Preserve emitted asset boundaries and sort eligible blobs by bytes descending with an emitted-identity ascending tie-break. | 162-01, 162-06 |
| D-03 | Re-render after each selection and stop once final HTML including private metadata is below the target. | 162-01, 162-06, 162-07 |
| D-04 | Exhaustion above target is successful and visibly reported; the threshold is not conformance or a build hard error. | 162-01, 162-06, 162-07 |
| D-05 | Pair through terminal `nostrconnect://` QR with the existing pasted `bunker://` race. | 162-02, 162-03, 162-07 |
| D-06 | Request only NIP-46 public-key access and signing scoped to Blossom authorization kind `24242`. | 162-02, 162-03, 162-07 |
| D-07 | Persist/reuse `nbunksec` through protected platform stores while keeping it, the client private key, and signer secrets out of artifacts, logs, cache, and config. | 162-02, 162-03, 162-07, 162-08 |
| D-08 | Extract/reuse tested CLI signer and key-store behavior rather than reimplementing NIP-46 in Vite. | 162-02, 162-03 |
| D-09 | Query a bounded directory set including `wss://purplepag.es` for the signer-authored replaceable kind `10002`. | 162-04, 162-05, 162-07 |
| D-10 | Verify events and select newest kind `10002` by `created_at` with a deterministic tie-break. | 162-04, 162-05, 162-07 |
| D-11 | Query write/unmarked relays from kind `10002` for signer-authored kind `10063`, select newest valid, and preserve normalized/deduplicated `server` tag order. | 162-04, 162-05, 162-07 |
| D-12 | Never treat kind `10002` relay tags as Blossom servers. | 162-04, 162-05, 162-07 |
| D-13 | If no valid user server list remains, use a deliberate visible fallback/error path and never impersonate an unrelated server as user preference. | 162-04, 162-05, 162-07 |
| D-14 | Hash and upload exact emitted bytes using the existing BUD authorization/upload compatibility behavior. | 162-01, 162-04, 162-05, 162-07 |
| D-15 | Emit selected references only as `blossom:sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` from the published NAP-RESOURCE proposal. | 162-01, 162-04, 162-07 |
| D-16 | Embed deterministic private JSON mapping emitted identity to URI, hash, bytes, and MIME. | 162-01, 162-07 |
| D-17 | Present the mapping only as tool-owned signed-artifact plumbing, never as a NIP-5A/NIP-5D/NAP field, message, handshake, or conformance rule. | 162-01, 162-07 |
| D-18 | Remove emitted files only after required uploads succeed on at least one selected server and final references/hashes verify. | 162-01, 162-07 |
| D-19 | Resolve browser resources through existing `window.napplet.resource.bytes`/`bytesMany`, never raw network or a new protocol message. | 162-01, 162-06, 162-07 |
| D-20 | Automatically replace only explicitly supported game-oriented consumers; preserve/skip other reference shapes and document them. | 162-06, 162-07, 162-08 |
| D-21 | Retain runtime hash verification at the NAP-RESOURCE boundary. | 162-01, 162-06, 162-07 |
| D-22 | Generate a deterministic fixture totaling at least 50 MiB without committing large binaries. | 162-08 |
| D-23 | Demonstrate measured input, selection order, final size, metadata, authenticated upload, replacements, and byte-identical recovery. | 162-08 |
| D-24 | Update package docs and changesets for every changed shipped package. | 162-08 |
| D-25 | Run full repository gates, commit atomically, push the branch, and open a PR. | 162-08 |
| D-26 | Choose a clear public option/type while preserving automatic exact-threshold behavior. | 162-07 |
| D-27 | Use the smallest cross-runtime extraction that avoids package cycles and Deno-only imports in Vite. | 162-02, 162-03, 162-07 |
| D-28 | Choose a deterministic private JSON/loader shape that never impersonates protocol surface. | 162-01, 162-07 |
| D-29 | Choose bounded concurrency, retry, timeout, and secondary-server behavior while remaining fail-closed before local file deletion. | 162-04, 162-05, 162-06, 162-07 |

## External API Capability Matrix

The matrix defaults relevant capabilities to `INTEGRATE`. `OPT-OUT` rows are explicit non-requirements for this phase; they must not be implemented indirectly or converted into local protocol rules.

The fenced matrix is the machine-readable gate contract; the domain tables below provide human-readable rationale and canonical links.

### NIP-46 Remote Signer

Canonical source: [NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md).

| Published capability | Decision | Phase behavior / reason |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Client-initiated `nostrconnect://` connection | INTEGRATE | Generate an ephemeral client key, show a terminal QR, validate the connect secret, and clean up losing relay/input tasks. |
| Remote-signer-initiated `bunker://` connection | INTEGRATE | Accept the existing pasted fallback and race it against the QR flow. |
| `connect` | INTEGRATE | Request only the permissions needed by this build path and validate the response. |
| `get_public_key` | INTEGRATE | Obtain the user pubkey used to validate kind `10002`/`10063` authorship. |
| `sign_event` for kind `24242` | INTEGRATE | Sign short-lived per-server, per-hash Blossom authorization events. |
| Request/response kind `24133`, NIP-44 transport, relay switch indicated by signer | INTEGRATE | Reuse the tested signer implementation and honor signer-selected session relays within bounds. |
| `ping` | OPT-OUT | Reconnect plus `get_public_key` is the liveness path needed here; an extra keepalive command adds no build capability. |
| `nip04_encrypt`, `nip04_decrypt`, `nip44_encrypt`, `nip44_decrypt` as application RPC commands | OPT-OUT | The optimizer signs upload authorization only and must not request unrelated cryptographic authority. |
| `switch_relays` as an explicit client command | OPT-OUT | Session relay changes are handled by the reused signer library; the optimizer exposes no independent relay-control UI. |
| `logout` RPC | OPT-OUT | This phase persists/replaces/deletes the local session record but does not add a user-facing remote-signer account-management command. |

### Nostr Relay Discovery

Canonical sources: [NIP-65](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/65.md) and [NIP-B7](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/B7.md).

| Published capability | Decision | Phase behavior / reason |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Query replaceable kind `10002` | INTEGRATE | Use bounded public directory relays including `wss://purplepag.es`, verify signer-authored events, and deterministically select newest. |
| Interpret kind `10002` `r` markers | INTEGRATE | Use write and unmarked relays when retrieving the user's authored kind `10063`; exclude read-only relays. |
| Query replaceable kind `10063` | INTEGRATE | Verify signer authorship/signature, deterministically select newest, and retain ordered valid `server` tags. |
| Publish or mutate kind `10002`/`10063` | OPT-OUT | The build consumes the user's published preferences and must not change them. |
| Treat kind `10002` relays as storage servers | OPT-OUT | NIP-65 relay metadata and Blossom server preferences are distinct capability domains. |

### Blossom HTTP and BUDs

Canonical inventory: [Blossom repository BUD index](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom#buds), with operation details in [BUD-00](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/00.md), [BUD-01](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/01.md), [BUD-02](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/02.md), [BUD-03](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/03.md), [BUD-04](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/04.md), [BUD-05](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/05.md), [BUD-06](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/06.md), [BUD-07](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/07.md), [BUD-08](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/08.md), [BUD-09](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/09.md), [BUD-10](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/10.md), [BUD-11](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/11.md), and [BUD-12](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/12.md).

| Published capability | Decision | Phase behavior / reason |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| BUD-00 SHA-256-addressed raw Blob model | INTEGRATE | Treat exact emitted bytes as the blob identity and never transform them between local hashing, upload, descriptor verification, and recovery. |
| BUD-01 `HEAD /<sha256>` existence check | INTEGRATE | Check content-addressed existence before an upload; validate every redirect target with the same public-network policy. |
| BUD-01 `GET /<sha256>` retrieval and optional range support | INTEGRATE via existing runtime | NAP-RESOURCE owns retrieval and hash verification; the build tool adds no direct browser/server fetch path. |
| BUD-02 `PUT /upload` exact-byte upload | INTEGRATE | Send exact emitted bytes with MIME, length, and `X-SHA-256`; accept only a descriptor matching local hash and byte count. |
| BUD-02 descriptor core fields | INTEGRATE | Validate `url`, lowercase `sha256`, `size`, `type`, and `uploaded`; ignore untrusted extra fields for control flow. |
| BUD-03 ordered kind `10063` server list | INTEGRATE | Preserve normalized first occurrence and attempt the first valid user server before secondary servers. |
| BUD-04 `PUT /mirror` | OPT-OUT | Direct exact-byte upload to each chosen secondary server avoids delegating a remote-fetch SSRF surface and preserves identical upload validation. |
| BUD-05 `HEAD /media` and `PUT /media` transforms | OPT-OUT | Media transforms intentionally change bytes/hashes, conflicting with emitted-byte identity and deterministic replacement. |
| BUD-06 `HEAD /upload` preflight | OPT-OUT | It is optional and non-binding; hash existence followed by the authoritative `PUT /upload` is sufficient. |
| BUD-07 payment negotiation | OPT-OUT | A noninteractive build cannot settle invoices; `402` is a redacted optimization failure that preserves the local artifact. |
| BUD-08 NIP-94 descriptor tags | OPT-OUT | Optional descriptor metadata is unrelated to the private emitted-asset mapping. |
| BUD-09 `PUT /report` | OPT-OUT | Reporting abusive blobs is unrelated to build publication. |
| BUD-10 Blossom URI schema | OPT-OUT | This artifact is bound to the different canonical `blossom:sha256:<hash>` form defined by NAP-RESOURCE; the two URI grammars must not be conflated. |
| BUD-11 kind `24242` `upload` authorization | INTEGRATE | Use human-readable content, short expiration, `t=upload`, exact lowercase `x` tags, lowercase-domain server scope, verified signer result, Base64url `Nostr` authorization encoding, and redacted diagnostics. |
| BUD-11 auth for download, mirror, media, list, or delete actions | OPT-OUT | Only upload authorization is requested; no unrelated signer authority is needed. |
| BUD-12 `GET /list/<pubkey>` | OPT-OUT | Listing is optional/unrecommended and unnecessary for content-addressed upload. |
| BUD-12 `DELETE /<sha256>` | OPT-OUT | Destructive remote lifecycle management is outside an optimizing build and would require separate explicit user intent. |

### NAP-RESOURCE Runtime

Canonical source: [NAP-RESOURCE proposal](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/80).

| Published capability | Decision | Phase behavior / reason |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| `blossom:sha256:<lowercase hash>` | INTEGRATE | This is the sole emitted external-resource URI form. |
| `resource.bytes` | INTEGRATE | Resolve lazy single-resource browser consumers through the injected domain. |
| `resource.bytesMany` | INTEGRATE | Resolve deterministic bounded groups, retaining per-item ordering and errors. |
| Runtime hash verification before Blob delivery | INTEGRATE | Treat returned bytes as usable only after the existing runtime integrity boundary succeeds. |
| Whole-Blob delivery | INTEGRATE | Tests and docs bound supported consumers to complete Blob semantics. |
| Streaming, range, progress, or a portable 50 MiB single blob | OPT-OUT | The proposal does not define those operations; the fixture uses several individually modest assets and documents the limitation. |
| New loader envelope, manifest tag, shell handshake, raw network grant | OPT-OUT | No such protocol surface exists; private loader/table bytes remain inside signed `/index.html`. |
