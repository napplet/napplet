# Phase 162 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Vitest 4.1.2 for `@napplet/vite-plugin` and `@napplet/build-tools`; Deno test for cross-runtime and existing CLI regressions; Node test for the secret scanner |
| **Config file** | `packages/vite-plugin/vitest.config.ts`; `packages/build-tools/package.json`; `packages/cli/deno.json` |
| **Quick run command** | The targeted `<automated>` command for the active task |
| **Full suite command** | `pnpm -r test:unit` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~30 seconds quick; ~120 seconds full |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run that task's targeted command below before its atomic commit.
- **After Waves 2–7:** Run the targeted Vite/build-tools suites and touched Deno CLI files for that wave.
- **After Wave 8:** Run the generated fixture, secret scan, complete Deno CLI suite, `pnpm build`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm -r test:unit`, docs/link/JSR/release checks, and the pinned AI-slop gate.
- **Before `$gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green.
- **Max feedback latency:** 30 seconds for the quick suite.

## Per-Task Verification Map

Phase 162 has no ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS IDs, so the spec-less probe fallback was visibly skipped and generated no predicates. The `Requirement` column therefore cites the controlling decision range or canonical-boundary predicate rather than inventing an ID. Every final plan/task ID is listed below.

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] Before production logic in 162-01-01: create `packages/vite-plugin/src/optimizer/pipeline.test.ts` for boundary, selection, upload seam, rollback, and recovery.
- [ ] Before production logic in 162-02-02: create `packages/build-tools/src/signer.test.ts`; before 162-03-01/02 create `secret-store.test.ts` and `terminal.test.ts`.
- [ ] Before production logic in 162-05-01/02: create `discovery.test.ts`, `network-policy.test.ts`, and `blossom.test.ts` with forged/stale, SSRF/rebinding, descriptor, and partial-batch vectors.
- [ ] Before production logic in 162-07-01/02: create `references.test.ts` and `loader.test.ts` for every supported/ineligible form and whole-Blob boundary.
- [ ] Before Node/live wiring in 162-08-02 and 162-09-01/02: create `node-services.test.ts` and `security.test.ts`, including conditional `['requires','resource']`, callback behavior, rollback, final hash, and every high-severity threat.
- [ ] Before phase demonstration sign-off in 162-10-01: create the deterministic generated 50 MiB+ local relay/Blossom plus fake NAP-RESOURCE fixture using multiple individually bounded blobs.
- [ ] Before outward actions in 162-11-01/02: create the secret scanner/tests covering final HTML, manifest, temporary build files, reports, config/cache-facing artifacts, staged diff, PR body, and captured logs.

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Terminal QR legibility and real remote-signer pairing | D-05–D-07 | Automated tests can validate URI, QR renderer calls, paste fallback, reconnect, and redaction, but cannot guarantee a particular terminal or third-party signer UI | Run the optimized generated example without a stored signer, scan the displayed `nostrconnect://` QR with a NIP-46 signer, authorize only `get_public_key` and kind `24242` signing, rebuild, and confirm stored reconnect avoids a second pairing prompt |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [x] All tasks have `<automated>` verify and named test-first dependencies where production behavior is added.
- [x] Sampling continuity: every task has an automated verify command.
- [x] Wave 0 identifies every missing test artifact before dependent implementation.
- [x] No watch-mode flags.
- [x] Targeted feedback latency is planned below 30 seconds except the intentionally generated large fixture and final full gates.
- [x] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter.

**Approval:** planned; `wave_0_complete` remains false until the named tests are created and observed red during execution.
